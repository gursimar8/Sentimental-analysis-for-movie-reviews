**Objective:**

The main objective of this project is to use sentimental analysis in the aviation sector to compare the popularity of three different airlines selected. 
I have used R software to perform this analysis. 
The approach is to count the positive and negative words in each tweet and assign a sentiment score. This way, we can ascertain how positive or negative a tweet is. We extract the tweets relating to Delta, JetBlue and United Airlines using hashtag Delta, JetBlue and United.
